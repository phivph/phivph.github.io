I am still working on it, please be patient.


In the meantime check out the selfie on the right side of this website. 

If you are curious about it, you can [*click here to watch my TEDx talk*](https://www.ted.com/talks/phivos_phylactou_beyond_what_our_eyes_perceive "Beyond what our Eyes Perceive"), where I explain what is going on!

## About me

### Biosketch

Hi, I am Phivos Phylactou!
I am currenlty a PhD Candidate in the Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, at Cyprus University of Technology.

I have a BSc in Psychology, which I have obtained from Frederick University in 2019, where I graduated as the Valedictorian.

My background in psychology made me curious about the neuroscientific basis of cognitive processes. Therefore, I am keen on investigating healthy individuals to discover basic neuroscientific evidence about perception, memory, and attention, with the use of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, eye-tracking, brain imaging, and behavioural experiments. I also promote science communication and open science practises.

### What I do {.tabset}
Here's a few things that I do in my every day life. 

This can give you an indication on how we can *collaborate*.

Please feel free to [contact me](https://phivph.github.io/contact.html) to *establish a collaboration*, *clarify something you saw here* (or elsewhere), or to simply *say hi*!

<br>

#### Research
Most of my work life is dedicated to scientific research.

You can check out the [***Projects***](https://phivph.github.io/projects.html) tab to find out the details of my work!

Or, have a look at the [list of my publications](https://phivph.github.io/publications.html), if you don't already have an overwhelming *"to read"* list!

#### Science Communication
I am also very keen on promoting *science communication*. 

I have delivered numerous science communication workshops to scientists, for numerous organisations such as the Cyprus Research and Innovation Foundation. You can check out this [youtube video](https://youtu.be/aT99vnwat8U) as an example from an online workshop.

Another example of passion for science communication, is found in my [TEDx talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/phivos_phylactou_beyond_what_our_eyes_perceive), which was given in my hometown, Limassol, as part of a TEDx youth event. 

#### Non-formal education
I've had the opportunity to deliver plenty of lectures & trainings.

Either as part of my course teaching, as an invited speaker, or during other events (e.g., Erasmus+ projects)

One of my favorite kind of teaching approaches, involves non-formal education methods. As a matter of fact, I try to embrace such methods in almost all of my teachings. 

Non-formal education is an interactive, fun, and creative way to transfer knowledge.

Here's one of my [favorite workshops](https://youtu.be/SNAuX1uYbXM), which I delivered in Germany for Young Friends of the Earth, Europe, in 2019.
