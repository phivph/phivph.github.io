Hi, I am Phivos!

Welcome to my personal webpage. Here you can find out some details regarding what I do.

<img align="right" width="100" height="200" src="/files/selfillussion.jpg">

I am an **experimental psychologist** interested in **cognitive neuroscience**. In short, I spend most of my time bringing people into a lab, having them play some boring video games, while zapping their brain with magnetic pulses, using a machine called *Transcranial Magnetic Stimulator* (TMS). 

TMS is a safe, non-invasive, and reliable tool for brain stimulation. I use it to understand how the brain processes visual information. You can read more on that [here](https://phivph.github.io/projects.html).  


I am excited to understand **how we make sense of the world around us**. How does our brain process and store information? For example, why does the selfie on the right side of this website look so weird? 

Can you make sense of it?

If you are curious about what is going on, you can [*click here to watch my TEDx talk*](https://www.ted.com/talks/phivos_phylactou_beyond_what_our_eyes_perceive "Beyond what our Eyes Perceive"), where I explain what is happening!

## About me

### Biosketch

<img align="left" width="180" height="180" src="/files/mePresenting.jpg">

I am currenlty a **PhD Candidate** in the Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, at Cyprus University of Technology.

I have a BSc in **Psychology**, which I have obtained from Frederick University in 2019, where I graduated as the **Valedictorian**.

My background in psychology made me curious about the **neuroscientific basis of cognitive processes**. Therefore, I am keen on investigating the neurologically healthy or damaged brain to discover basic neuroscientific evidence about perception, memory, and attention, with the use of **non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, eye-tracking, brain imaging, and behavioral experiments**. I also promote **science communication** and **open science practices**.

### What I do {.tabset}
Here's a few things that I do in my every day life. 

This can give you an indication of how we can **collaborate**.

Please feel free to [contact me](https://phivph.github.io/contact.html) to establish a collaboration, clarify something you saw here (or elsewhere), or to simply say hi!

<br>

#### Research
##### Research:
Most of my work life is dedicated to scientific research.

You can check out the [**Projects**](https://phivph.github.io/projects.html) tab to find out the details of my work!

Or, have a look at the [list of my publications](https://phivph.github.io/publications.html), if you don't already have an overwhelming *"to read"* list!
<br>
<br>

#### Science Communication
##### Science Communication:
I am also very keen on promoting *science communication*. 

I have delivered numerous science communication workshops to scientists, for numerous organisations such as the Cyprus Research and Innovation Foundation. You can check out this [youtube video](https://youtu.be/aT99vnwat8U) as an example from an online workshop.

Another example of passion for science communication, is found in my [TEDx talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/phivos_phylactou_beyond_what_our_eyes_perceive), which was given in my hometown, Limassol, as part of a TEDx youth event. 
<br>
<br>

#### Non-formal education
##### Non-formal education:
I've had the opportunity to deliver plenty of lectures & trainings.

Either as part of my course teaching, as an invited speaker, or during other events (e.g., Erasmus+ projects)

One of my favorite kind of teaching approaches, involves non-formal education methods. As a matter of fact, I try to embrace such methods in almost all of my teachings. 

Non-formal education is an interactive, fun, and creative way to transfer knowledge.

Here's one of my [favorite workshops](https://youtu.be/SNAuX1uYbXM), which I delivered in Germany for Young Friends of the Earth, Europe, in 2019.  
<br>
<br>

#### Teaching
##### Teching:
Sharing knowledge and expertise is one of the most fulfilling experiences in my academic journey so far.

Luckily, I was privileged enough to take on a lot of teaching opportunities, as an invited lecturer, a teaching assistant, and as a lecturer. 

This has helped me develop my own teaching philosophy & style. 

Currently, I am a visiting lecturer at Frederick University, in Cyprus, where I teach **Psychology of Learning** and **Developmental Psychology** to nursery students.

Other courses that I have been involved in, during my teaching assistanships at the Cyprus University of Technology, include **Cognitive Neuroscience** & **Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation**.

My teaching, is strongly influenced by my non-formal education expertise, as well as by my passion with science communication.
