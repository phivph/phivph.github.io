Hello and welcome to my personal website!

I am still working on it, so there is nothing much to see here.

In the meantime you can [*click here*](https://phivph.github.io/publications.html) to see a list of my publications.

Also, check out the selfie, on the side of this website. 

If you are curious about it, you can [*click here to watch my TEDx talk*](https://www.ted.com/talks/phivos_phylactou_beyond_what_our_eyes_perceive "Beyond what our Eyes Perceive"), where I explain what is going on! 

## What I do {.tabset}
Here's a few things that I do in my every day life. 
This can give you an indication on how we can *collaborate*.
Please feel free to [contact me](https://phivph.github.io/contact.html) to *establish a collaboration*, *clarify something you saw here* (or elsewhere), or to simply *say hi*!

### Research
Most of my work life is dedicated to scientific research. 
You can check out the [project tab](https://phivph.github.io/projects.html) to find out the details of my work!

### Science Communication
I am also very keen on promoting *science communication*. 

I have delivered numerous science communication workshops to scientists, for numerous organisations such as the Cyprus Research and Innovation Foundation. You can check out this [youtube video](https://youtu.be/aT99vnwat8U) as an example from an online workshop.

Another example of passion for science communication, is found in my [TEDx talk]((https://www.ted.com/talks/phivos_phylactou_beyond_what_our_eyes_perceive)
