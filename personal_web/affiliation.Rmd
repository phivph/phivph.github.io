### Current Affiliation
I am currently affiliated in the Department of Rehabilitation Sciences at [Cyprus University of Technology](https://www.cut.ac.cy/?languageId=1).

I work at the [Brain and Cognitive Science Lab](https://www.nkonstantinou.com/authors/phivos-phylactou/), led by Dr Nikos Konstantinou, where I study the neural underpinnings of Visual Short-Term Memory (VSTM) using non-invasive brain stimulation, eye-tracking, and other technologies.
 
 
### Secondary Affiliation
I am also part of the School of Science at [University of Central Lancashire Cyprus](https://www.uclancyprus.ac.cy), working on [VERITAS](https://www.uclancyprus.ac.cy/enarktiria-synantisi-toy-neoy-ereyni/), a Horizon Europe program funded by the European Commission, which studies the publicâ€™s trust in science and the ways in which this trust can be enhanced through responsible research.
