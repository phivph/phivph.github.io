## Understanding the Neural Underpinnings of VSTM
My main research interest is focused on understanding the nerual architecture of visual short-term memory. How are visual representations stored during working memory?

To study this, I combine behavioral experiments (think of these like some sort of very boring video games) with various technologies. 

The main tool I employ is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is a non-invasive, reliable, and safe tool to induce brain stimulation with high temporal & spatial resolution.

An animated example of a TMS paradigm is shown below:
