## Understanding the Neural Underpinnings of VSTM
My main research interest is focused on understanding the nerual architecture of visual short-term memory. How are visual representations stored during working memory?

To study this, I combine behavioral experiments (think of these like some sort of very boring video games) with various technologies. 

The main tool I employ is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is a non-invasive, reliable, and safe tool to induce brain stimulation with high temporal & spatial resolution.

An animated example of a TMS paradigm is shown below:

## Laterality
Did you notice that, as humans, we are extremely asymmetric?
Dominant hands, dominant eyes, asymmetric feet, placement of visceral organs, facial features!

I certainly haven't paid that much attention to this asymmetry, until I established an amazing collaboration with Dr [Marietta Papadatou-Pastou](https://www.mpapadatoupastou.com/#info), who's main research interest focuses on the behavioural aspects of laterality. 

You can check out the details of our laterality work [here](https://www.mpapadatoupastou.com/project/laterality/) to understand how we utilize functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, in order to figure out laterality in the brain during writing in both neurotypical individuals and individuals with atypical neurological development.
