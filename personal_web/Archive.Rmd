### Trust in Science
At the [University of Central Lancashire Cyprus](https://www.uclancyprus.ac.cy), I am working on [VERITY](https://www.uclancyprus.ac.cy/enarktiria-synantisi-toy-neoy-ereyni/).

VERITY is a **Horizon Europe** program funded by the European Commission, aiming to understand the **publicâ€™s trust in science** and the ways in which this trust can be **enhanced through responsible research**.

VERITY comprises of a consortium of **seven partners**, from seven European countries: Trilateral Research (United Kingdom and Ireland), EUREC Office (Germany), Science Business (Belgium), Centre for Social Innovation (Austria), UCLan Cyprus (Cyprus), and University of West Attica (Greece).

My contribution to VERITY is mainly related to the implementation of **quantitative meta-scientific methods** (i.e., meta-analyses).
