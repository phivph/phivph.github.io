# Hello and welcome to my personal website!

I am still working on it, so there is nothing much to see here.

In the meantime you can [*click here*](https://phivph.github.io/publications/) to see a list of my publications.

Also, check out the selfie, on the side of this website. 

If you are curious about it, you can [*click here to watch my TEDx talk*](https://www.ted.com/talks/phivos_phylactou_beyond_what_our_eyes_perceive "Beyond what our Eyes Perceive"), where I explain what is going on! 


I'll be back with more! 

**See you soon!**
